This is the geometry I used to render between 4 vertices

(Update: this is old. Currently using quaternion) This is how I calculated the spherical rotation

(Update: this is old. Currently using quaternion) This is the orientation of the spherical rotation. Changed the third formula to make xy = 00 to face up
